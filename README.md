## Electronic System Solution

The final product will be divided into 4 modules:
- Sensors - constains sensors for air quality monitoring and moving objects detection for usage statistics and safety. This module has its own microcontroller to process all sensor data.
- Communication - contains module to construct a mesh topology network, that can quickly react and warn a user of any danger that may happen.
- Light - LEDs that give information about the current state of a certain section of the road. Its a mix of projected light (high brightness LEDs) and diret light.
- Power - a system that takes de mains power and is able to power all the other modules, as well as charge a battery pack that keeps the system working during the day.
- Web Server - a processing and storing unit, that keeps track of data received from the poles and sends them information if needed. It's also the source of the information used in the mobile app.
- Mobile App - it's where all information will be shared with the user, regarding for example air quality and road usage. It may also be used to warn about a potential danger ahead.
